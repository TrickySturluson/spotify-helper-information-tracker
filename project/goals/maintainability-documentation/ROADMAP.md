# Maintainability & Documentation — Roadmap

**Last reviewed:** 2026-11-05  
**Status:** In progress. The documentation control structure is established; the full file-level coverage and freshness audit remains open.

## Purpose
Make SHIT understandable, maintainable, and recoverable by a contributor or assistant with no access to prior chat history. Repository documentation—not chat memory—is the durable source of truth.

## Established structure
- Root [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md): mandatory instructions for every assistant/contributor session.
- [Documentation rules](../../DOCUMENTATION_RULES.md): required reading, same-session updates, evidence vocabulary and completion checklist.
- [Documentation index](../../../docs/README.md): navigation to technical references and workstreams.
- [Project roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md): cross-workstream priorities and dependencies.
- [NEXT_WORK.md](../../NEXT_WORK.md), [LOOSE_ENDS.md](../../LOOSE_ENDS.md), and [PROJECT_LOG.md](../../PROJECT_LOG.md): current handoff, unresolved work, and chronology.
- [Goal index](../README.md): 13 goal workspaces, each expected to contain ROADMAP, README and ACTIONS.
- [Repository file index](../../../docs/REPOSITORY_FILE_INDEX.md): tracked file and directory inventory.

## Required per-file documentation
Every maintained script/module/workflow should state its purpose, supported goal, inputs/outputs, dependencies/data paths, network and write side effects, safety/rate/mutation boundaries, and how to run/test it. Tests and schemas should have clear scope and ownership. Do not put prose into machine-readable JSON; use adjacent documentation or supported metadata.

## Roadmap
1. **Mandatory continuity rules and navigation — implemented.** Root instructions, documentation rules, docs index, project roadmap and README links now exist on main.
2. **Verify all goal workspaces.** Confirm every indexed goal has ROADMAP, README and ACTIONS; inspect links and reconcile current status.
3. **Audit file-level coverage.** Compare all tracked scripts, modules, compatibility launchers, tests, workflows, schemas and data contracts with the file index and per-file overview requirements.
4. **Repair high-risk documentation gaps.** Prioritize write-capable tools, scheduled workflows, authentication, shared generated-state writers, safety policies and recovery paths.
5. **Automate checks.** Add maintainable link/path checks and meaningful documentation coverage checks; avoid brittle boilerplate-only checks.
6. **Reconcile cross-project records.** Keep NEXT_WORK, LOOSE_ENDS, PROJECT_LOG, project roadmap and goal roadmaps synchronized with current GitHub evidence.
7. **Fresh-session test.** Verify a new assistant can identify priorities, constraints, exact next actions and verification commands from repository docs alone.

## Acceptance criteria
- Every indexed goal has ROADMAP, README and ACTIONS with current links.
- Every maintained executable file has a useful overview or an explicit adjacent-documentation entry; no file is falsely marked covered.
- File index matches the tracked repository inventory and identifies generated versus canonical data.
- Operational docs identify inputs, outputs, side effects, permissions, safety boundaries, failure/retry behavior and verification.
- A fresh session can resume each active goal without chat history.
- Meaningful work updates relevant documentation in the same session; status claims cite exact evidence.

## Automated guardrails — implemented and CI-verified for current core contract
- Added `tests/test_documentation_contract.py` to enforce required control documents, all goal workspaces' ROADMAP/README/ACTIONS files, AGENTS continuity requirements, major documentation-domain coverage, and local links from the primary entry points.
- Existing `tests/test_script_layout.py` checks bottom `FILE OVERVIEW` coverage across maintained Python implementation, compatibility, tests and GitHub Actions workflow files.
- The repository's standard unittest discovery includes both tests; `.github/workflows/update.yml` runs the full suite before data publishing. A successful CI run after this new test is required before calling the guardrail verified.

## Repository inventory correction — implemented
- Replaced the stale exhaustive file snapshot with a maintained source and data-family index. The previous snapshot incorrectly implied a small, static `assistant_data` file count despite the expanded per-record canonical music Library.
- The new index distinguishes canonical Last.fm scrobbles, canonical structured music Library records, generated analytics/profiles, optional playback observations, Spotify playlist state/feedback, source code, tests, and GitHub automation.
- It documents commands for retrieving the exact current tracked path inventory instead of embedding a stale generated-record listing.

## Current gaps / uncertainty
- The full tracked-file inventory has not yet been compared programmatically with documentation coverage.
- Goal status and cross-project loose ends need reconciliation against current main, open PRs/issues and latest workflow runs.
- Link integrity and whether every referenced guide still exists have not yet been exhaustively checked.
- Existing per-file overview claims in the repository README are not yet independently audited.

## Next action
Obtain a complete tracked-file listing from the repository, compare it with file overviews and docs/REPOSITORY_FILE_INDEX.md, then record a categorized gap list. Fix high-risk missing documentation first and add automated checks after the baseline is known.
