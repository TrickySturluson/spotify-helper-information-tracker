# Tricky Daily — Actions & Evidence

Newest entries first. Separate implemented behavior from plans, test evidence, live API acceptance, and independent read-back verification.

## 2026-11-05 — Dedicated Daily workstream documentation created

- **Purpose:** preserve Tricky Daily as an independently resumable active workstream rather than relying only on a long feature backlog nested under Playlist Intelligence.
- **User requirements captured:** exactly 60 unique tracks; absolute removed-track/blacklist protection; whitelist reconciliation; forced-run parity; description refresh on forced runs; bounded retries and artist-diversity relaxation; feedback that distinguishes exposure from preference and handles missing playback coverage neutrally; explicit live verification.
- **Documentation created:** ROADMAP.md defines purpose, invariants, prioritized milestones, acceptance criteria, known verification gaps and next action. README.md maps implementation, workflows, tests and safe resume procedure. Existing docs/TRICKY_DAILY_TODO.md and docs/TRICKY_DAILY_CYCLE.md remain detailed feature references and were not replaced.
- **Implementation status:** documentation references the current maintained Daily modules and workflows. This entry does not claim every P0 item is implemented or that the current live playlist has been verified.
- **Verification:** source documentation and file paths were cross-checked against the repository's Daily cycle guide, TODO, workflow naming and known test modules. The new workspace has not yet been included in a successful post-creation documentation-contract CI run.
- **Outcome:** dedicated workspace initialized; runtime behavior unchanged.
- **Next action:** add this goal to the goal index and project roadmap, then let the documentation contract test verify that ROADMAP/README/ACTIONS exist. Audit the latest Daily code and workflow evidence against the P0 checklist.
